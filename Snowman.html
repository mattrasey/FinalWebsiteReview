		<p>The Happy Snowman was the last character I worked on before my second semester of junior year. With ambient occlusion and complex cloth textures, my renders were a little longer than most of my models. I had a lot of fun playing with different bump maps for each material, which needed to be perfect for the snow and carrot.  This was the first time I utilized displacement maps for the cufflinks and brim of his festive hat. Altogether, I enjoyed with how the finished product came out. </p>
